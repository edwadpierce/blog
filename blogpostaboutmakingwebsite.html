Blog Post About Making Website
</h1>
<p>
  so I made this website with github pages and porkbun, it uses html (I think it can use markdown too)
  I bought this domain name on porkbun, and then make this github repo, and made some html files, 
  and then I had to go to the github settings to make this a "github pages" thing, and then it would have 
  shown up at username.github.io, but porkbun has a button where you can tell it to do a redirect kind of thing 
  to github, so when you access luke.araldi.xyz, you are just accessing username.github.io. and then I had to go 
  back to github to tell it that I have this website. now, trying to figure out links was annoying, because when 
  I told it to go to luke.araldi.xyz/blogpostaboutmakingthiswebsite.html, it would go to luke.araldi.xyz/luke.araldi.xyz/blogpostaboutmakingthiswebsite.html
  so I ended up just telling it to go to /blogpostaboutmakingthiswebsite.html, and that's problematic because I 
  don't know how I would make a link to a website that's not mine.
